TODO:
1. Run Security PLS model
  a. Make sure you can find actual values, fitted values and residuals from PLS
    - actual values: trust_actual_scores <- sec_pls_full$construct_scores[, "TRUST"]
    - fitted values:
      - fitted <- predict(sec_pls_full, security_data_sem)
      - trust_item_fitted_scores <- fitted$predicted_items[, 1:4]
      - we have to make the construct scores from the item data
      - trust_weights <- sec_pls_full$outer_weights[,"TRUST"][1:4]
      - trust_fitted_construct_scores <- trust_item_fitted_scores %*% trust_weights
      - trust_fitted_std_scores <- scale(trust_fitted_construct_scores)
    - trust_fitted_residuals <- trust_actual_scores - trust_fitted_std_scores
2. Try a residual bootstrap
3. Try a wild bootstrap
