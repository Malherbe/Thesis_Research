TODO:
1. Run Security PLS model
  a. Make sure you can find actual values, fitted values and residuals from PLS
    - actual values: sec_pls_full$construct_scores
    - fitted values:
      - fitted <- predict(sec_pls_full, security_data_sem)
      - fitted$predicted_items
      - we have to make the construct scores from the item data
      - trust_weights <- sec_pls_full$outer_weights[,"TRUST"][1:4]
2. Try a residual bootstrap
3. Try a wild bootstrap
